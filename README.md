# Social app

## Description
The goal of this app is to be simple and easy to use because the target group is people 65+.
This app should help the user get familiar with the basic features of a social media app so that they can more easily adapt to a more complex app like Facebook.
This app was designed for tablet devices.

## Executing this project

In order to run this project on a computer, the following tools will be needed:
- Android Studio
- Dart package installed
- Android device emulator

While there are .apk files available to install on a physical device, due to an oversight during development, 
    the UI elements in the app where given fixed heights and widths which caused them to be out of place when run on a different sized screen.
If choosing to use the .apk files, due to Android devices using different types of CPU's, a .apk file might not be compatible with your device, so you will need to try another file.

### For this reason, it is recommended that this project is run on Android studio emulator using the 10.1 WXGA Tablet with android 9.0 and API 28.

This sizing problem will be addressed once this project has been graded so that it is compatible with different sized tablet devices.
